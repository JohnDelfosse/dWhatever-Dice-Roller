# dWhatever-Dice-Roller
A Basic DND Dice Roller that can roll 1-10 dice of each type of basic DND die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100). It shows each die's output and the total.

For now, it is a basic python text file, but I hope to give it more visuals soon!

## That's pretty cool Jack but how do I use this?
If any of my non-techy friends wanna try this app in its current state you can copy the code from main.py into [this website](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) and then hit the "Run" button
